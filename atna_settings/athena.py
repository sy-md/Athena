        Messages:
            Make a list containing a series of short text messages.
             Pass the list to a function called show_messages(),
              which prints each text message.
        Sending Messages:
            Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 8-9. Write a function
             called send_messages() that prints each text message and moves each
              message to a new list called sent_messages as itâ€™s printed.
               After calling the function, print both of your lists to make
                sure the messages were moved correctly.
        Archived Messages:
            Start with your work from Exercise 8-10. Call the function
             send_messages() with a copy of the list of messages. After calling
              the function,print both of your lists to show that the original
               list has retained its messages.
